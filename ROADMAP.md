# BigchainDB Roadmap

We are drafting a high-level description of what we plan to do next and will publish it here on November 4. Some highlights:

* Improved user experience
* More benchmarking
* Steps to get IPDB to production
* Support for MongoDB as an alternative backend database

## Waffle Board

We have [a "waffle board" (on waffle.io)](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org/) which gives a high-level overview of all issues and pull requests from across all BigchainDB repositories on GitHub. You may find it interesting. The **Done** column is things closed in the last week. **New PRs + R-Issues (ref'd by new branches)** is an auto-populated column listing 1) new pull requests and 2) issues where a new branch referencing that issue was created.
