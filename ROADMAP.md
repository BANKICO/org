# BigchainDB Roadmap

[**This board**](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org/) is a high-level roadmap for BigchainDB and related projects. It shows relevant repositories on GitHub (i.e. [all GitHub repos in the organization named `bigchaindb`](https://github.com/bigchaindb) [on GitHub]). 

Legend for board's columns:
* **Open Issues**: Open issues not in any other column (because a "when: ___" label hasn't been assigned yet)
* **when: In the future**: Issues and PRs with the "when: In the future" label
* **when: In <1 mo**: Issues and PRs with the "when: In <1 mo" label
* **New PRs + R-Issues (ref'd by new branches)**: New PRs + issues where a new branch referencing that issue was created
* **when: In progress**: Issues and PRs with the "when: In progress" label
* **Done**: Issues closed in the last week

You can filter that board by label, who is assigned, milestone, and source repo. Shortcuts for specific labels:

| **Label** | **Meaning** |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Project-Issue](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org?label=Project-Issue) | Projects only |
| [topic: SEC core consensus](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org?label=topic:%20SEC%20core%20consensus) | Security, core, consensus |
| [topic: D&P deplymt perf](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org?label=topic:%20D%26P%20deplymt%20perf) | Deployment, performance |
| [topic: TXS assets data](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org?label=topic:%20TXS%20assets%20data) | Transactions, assets, data |
| [topic: UX docs cmd api driver](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org?label=topic:%20UX%20docs%20cmd%20api%20driver) | User experience, documentation, drivers, API |
| [topic: IPDB](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org?label=topic:%20IPDB) | IPDB |
| [topic: IP PLAT a.io wotn](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org?label=topic:%20IP%20PLAT%20a.io%20wotn) | IP platform, ascribe.io, whereonthe.net |

To combine filters in the board interface, click the funnel icon in the top right corner of the board.

At the time of writing, you can't filter to get all PRs & issues with the "when: In the future" label because that label is used to define a column. It's [a known waffle.io bug](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/issues/2327). It's not a big problem, because if you want to see all the PRs & issues with that label, you can just look in the **when: In the future** column. The same is true of other columns defined by labels.

## Physical Planning Board

Below is a photo the physical planning board in the ascribe office. It's similar to the waffle.io board showing projects only ([link](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org?label=Project-Issue)). We aim to update it weekly.
